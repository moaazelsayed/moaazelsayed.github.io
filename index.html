				<h2>Where do I start?<br />
					Well, When I was born...</h2>
				</header>
				<p>When I was born, in the great and majestic mountains of Tuholok, a very unique and magical phenomenon occurred; It was foretold that it only happened once in a million years, when a gifted child is born. Unfortunately, that gifted child was my neighbor who was also born on the same day. Jokes and stories aside, I'm a normal (somewhat creative) guy who has a strong knack for electrical &amp; mechanical gadgets (Robots!) and a love for outer space and space exploration. Most of all, I love to write code... clean, fast, code. A close friend of mine, that first introduced me to programming, said it was the closest thing to magic, that still holds true for me until today. Anyways, without me blabbering too much, I've listed some of my projects below. Check them out!

							<h3>PC Hacks (University of Toronto Hackathon)</h3>
							<p>Won <b>1st place</b> (Best use of robotics/hardware) in Toronto's regional Hackathon. Led a team to create a brail printer that uses motors on 3 axis to poke coordinated holes into paper making brail letters. The printer was built using items bought from the dollar store. An Arduino microcontroller was used to receive sentences and coordinate the motors to print the sentences in brail.
